## Fiddle

Fiddle aims to work with the student to find time based on their study schedule and work around events. Although
students may find pockets within their day to workout, what’s important is making sure that the workout aims to target
different areas of the body while making physical activity fun and engaging by creating a variety of workout plans
depending on the day, time, and daily willingness to put in the effort to work hard. According to a study conducted by
the University of Maribor, out of 297 surveyed undergraduate students, 79.8% were considered to be physically inactive
according to WHO guidelines. There is scientific evidence on physical activity being linked to better clarity, mental
well being, and overall good health. In order to foster wellness and productivity within university students, ourselves
included, we’ve designed Fiddle to touch on this problem
